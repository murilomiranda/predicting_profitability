Our sales team is developing a new business strategy, so they want to add some new products to the catalog. However, they do not know which products should be selected. So far, they have a list of 17 new products, but they only want five new ones. In this analysis, we assume that certain attributes are associated with highly successful (current) products and, therefore, any potential new products that also have these attributes will be similarly successful.


Our goal was to create a predictive model to select five new products from a list of 17 products, with greater profitability. Therefore, we need to forecast the sales volume for each of the potential new products.
